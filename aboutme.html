    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>Hello I'm Narinder</div>
    <br>
    I'm currently a senior customer consultant, however technology is something I have been passionate about for as long
    as I can remember.<br>Technology has never failed to amaze me and fortunately I have been in the right generation to
    be able to keep up and observe the impact that it has on the world.<br> For me, the most attractive aspect of
    technology is problem solving. The potential of where we could be in terms of technology in 20 years’ time
    fascinates me.<br> It’s exciting to know that being involved in technology allows me to take my career in any
    direction.
